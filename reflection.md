Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents about a character which randomly moves around in different axis according the input as well gains energy through resting and eating while losing energy when walking to different place. Fly feature is currently not available as the character does not have the means to fly.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added a method for eating for the character to gain energy.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I believe I made a really basic program which could have been better if I use scanner to intake users input for creating a more interactive interface.
